# Meal-Planner-Api
Api that works with the Meal-Planner angular web app

Make sure to set DefaultConnection in appsettings.json and run Add-Migration 'migraion-name' and Update-Database
This program is running on localhost and the database I have used is a ms sql database also running on localhost. the database should be created before running addmigration and updatedatabase commands.
I named my database Recipe-API-Test
